## Overview

Millions of people apply to jobs every year without knowing exactly why they keep getting rejected. The problem is rarely that they're unqualified — it's that they don't know which specific skills are missing, how to close those gaps, or how to present what they already have more effectively.

SkillBridge solves this by acting as a personal AI career coach that:

- Reads your CV and the job description simultaneously
- Identifies **specific skill gaps** with honest importance ratings (critical / important / nice-to-have)
- Builds a **step-by-step learning roadmap** with real resources tailored to the industry
- Gives **salary context** so you know what the role is worth before you apply
- Tells you **exactly how to rewrite your CV** to improve your chances for that specific role
- Suggests **alternative roles** you might already be ready for

The system is industry-agnostic by design. The same pipeline that analyses a Software Engineer's CV against a job description works equally well for a Nurse, a Tax Lawyer, a UX Designer, or a Civil Engineer — the AI adapts its advice to the specific field.

---

## How the AI Works

When a CV and job description are submitted, the backend sends both to **Llama 3.3 70B** — Meta's most capable open-source model, served via Groq's ultra-fast inference API — with a detailed system prompt instructing it to act as a world-class career coach.

The model is prompted to return a **structured JSON object** containing all analysis fields, which the frontend parses and renders into the results dashboard.

The AI is explicitly instructed to:
- Tailor all advice to the **specific industry** — never give generic tech advice for a healthcare or legal role
- Be **honest** about gaps while remaining constructive and encouraging
- Suggest **real, named resources** that are actually relevant to the field
- Provide **concrete, actionable** next steps the user can take this week
- Grade skill importance as **critical, important, or nice-to-have** — not just a flat list

### Why Groq + Llama 3.3 70B

## Project Structure

```
skillbridge-ai/
├── app.py              # Flask backend — routes, file parsing, Groq API call
├── run.py              # Entry point — sets API key, starts server
├── index.html          # Complete frontend — single-file UI

## Getting a Free Groq API Key

1. Go to [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (no credit card needed)
3. Navigate to **API Keys** → **Create API Key**
4. Copy the key and paste it into `run.py`

Groq's free tier provides generous rate limits — more than enough for personal use, demos, and portfolio showcasing.

---

## Deployment

This app requires a running Python backend and **cannot be hosted on GitHub Pages** (which serves static files only).

### Free deployment on Render

1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → **New → Web Service**
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Set the following:
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `python run.py`
5. Add an **Environment Variable:** `GROQ_API_KEY = your-key-here`
6. Click **Deploy**

You will get a live public URL (e.g. `skillbridge-ai.onrender.com`) in approximately 5 minutes. The free tier is sufficient for demo and portfolio use.

## Requirements

```
flask
flask-cors
groq
pymupdf

## Limitations

- CV parsing quality depends on formatting — heavily stylised CVs (columns, tables, graphics) may not parse cleanly from PDF
- No persistent database — user accounts and analysis history are stored in browser localStorage only and will not persist across devices
- Llama 3.3 70B may occasionally produce less nuanced advice for very niche or highly specialised roles compared to larger proprietary models
- The app requires a live backend — it cannot be hosted as a static site
- No rate limiting implemented — not suitable for high-traffic public deployment without adding request throttling
- Salary data is AI-estimated and may not reflect current market rates in all regions

---

## Future Work

- [ ] Export full analysis as a PDF report
- [ ] Save and compare multiple analyses per user
- [ ] LinkedIn profile URL input — auto-parse CV from profile
- [ ] Job board integration — auto-fetch job descriptions from URL
- [ ] Backend database for persistent user accounts
- [ ] Rate limiting and usage quotas for public deployment
- [ ] Email delivery of analysis results
- [ ] CV rewrite assistant — full AI-powered CV editor
